(1) Create an account. You must supply a unique user name.
(2) List accounts (or a subset of the accounts, by text wildcard)
(3) Send a message to a recipient. If the recipient is logged in, deliver immediately; otherwise queue the message and deliver on demand. If the message is sent to someone who isn't a user, return an error message
(4) Deliver undelivered messages to a particular user
(5) Delete an account. You will need to specify the semantics of what happens if you attempt to delete an account that contains undelivered message.
